# Publish Blocks
 
## Purpose

Nicely organise primary and secondary content into blocks. Similar behaviour to the Publish Tabs extension, but it stacks content instead of hiding it.

## Installation
 
1. Upload the `/publish_blocks` folder to your Symphony `/extensions` folder
2. Enable it by selecting "Publish Blocks" in the list, choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply
3. When creating or editing a section you can add the "Publish Block" field


## Usage

Add one or more Publish Block field(s) to a section. Give each a sensible label. Save.

When you add a Publish Block field to a section, any fields that appear *after* this field in the field order will become part of that Block (both left and right columns).
