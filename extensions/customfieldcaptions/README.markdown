# Custom Field Captions

* Version: 0.4
* Author: Brendan Abbott
* Build Date: 20th August 2012
* Requirements: Symphony 2.3

Adds the ability to have a custom caption for each field on the Publish interface. Note that custom captions will override the default 'Optional' text and always replace it with your custom text.

## How do I use it?

1. Extract and install this extension to your `/extensions` folder

2. While creating your fields in the Section Editor, a new Custom Caption input will appear on each field

3. Save your fields as normal and dance!
