## Acknowledgement

This extension simply implements the jQuery Plugin: [Are-You-Sure (Dirty Form Detection)](https://github.com/codedance/jquery.AreYouSure/).

This extension is based on Nils Hörrmann’s [Backend Assets](https://github.com/symphonists/backend_assets) which is based on Michael Eichelsdörfer’s [Admin CSS Override](https://github.com/michael-e/admin_css_override).
