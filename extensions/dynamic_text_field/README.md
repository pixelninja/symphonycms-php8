# Dynamic Text Field

The Dynamic Text Field allows you to continually add text boxes to an entry. Essentially it's the same as @brendo's Meta Keys extension, but doesn't require a key/value pair.

## Installation

1. Upload the `/dynamic_text_field` folder to your Symphony `/extensions` folder.
2. Enable it by selecting the "Text Field", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.
3. You can now add the "Text Field" field to your Sections.

## Thanks

This is heavily based on @brendo's Meta Keys extension, so a big shout out to the legend.
