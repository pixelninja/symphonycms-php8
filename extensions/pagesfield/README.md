> A field that features a select box filled with Symphony's pages

## Installation

1. Upload the `pagesfield` folder in this archive to your Symphony `/extensions` folder.

3. You can now add the "Page Select Box" field to your sections.

## Sorting

The field sorts the pages according to the sortorder determined in 'Blueprints Â» Pages'. If the sorting isn't correct, it's probably because of the sortorder. To set the sortorder of your pages, edit your `config.php`, set `symphony/pages_table_nest_children` to `yes`, and sort the pages manually in your pages screen. When done, you can set `symphony/pages_table_nest_children` back to no (or keep it on yes, if that is your prefered way of working).
